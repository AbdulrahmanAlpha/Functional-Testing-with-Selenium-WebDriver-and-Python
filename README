## Introduction
Functional testing is a critical part of software testing that focuses on the overall functionality of a software application. In this project, we demonstrate how to use the Selenium WebDriver and Python to perform functional tests on a web application. We provide a simple example that navigates to a website, enters a search query, and verifies that the results page contains the expected text. This project is useful for software developers and testers who want to ensure that their web applications are functioning correctly.

## Requirements
To use this project, you'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)
- Selenium WebDriver for the browser you want to test (e.g. ChromeDriver for Google Chrome)

## Installation
1. Install the Selenium WebDriver for Python by running the following command:
```
pip install selenium
```

2. Download and install the appropriate WebDriver for the browser you want to test. For example, if you want to test Google Chrome, download the ChromeDriver from the following link: [https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads â†—](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads)

## Usage
1. Open a text editor or IDE of your choice and create a new Python script.

2. Import the necessary modules in your Python script:
```python
from selenium import webdriver
```

3. Create a new instance of the WebDriver for the browser you want to test:
```python
driver = webdriver.Chrome()
```

4. Navigate to the application you want to test:
```python
driver.get("http://www.example.com")
```

5. Find the HTML element you want to interact with using the WebDriver's find_element_* methods:
```python
search_field = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
```

6. Interact with the HTML element using its methods and properties:
```python
search_field.send_keys("Selenium WebDriver")
search_field.submit()
```

7. Verify that the expected results are displayed using the WebDriver's assert statement:
```python
assert "Selenium WebDriver" in driver.page_source
```

8. Close the WebDriver when you're finished:
```python
driver.quit()
```

## Conclusion
With this project, you can write functional tests that ensure your web applications are functioning correctly. You can customize these tests to include more complex scenarios and test cases, depending on your application's requirements. If you have any questions or feedback, please let us know!
