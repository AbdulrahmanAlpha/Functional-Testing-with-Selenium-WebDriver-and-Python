#Functional testing is a type of testing that focuses on the overall functionality of a software application. The following example demonstrates how to use the Selenium WebDriver and Python to perform functional tests on a web application:
from selenium import webdriver

# Create a new instance of the Chrome driver
driver = webdriver.Chrome()

# Navigate to the application
driver.get("http://www.example.com")

# Find the search field and enter a query
search_field = driver.find_element_by_name("q")
search_field.send_keys("Selenium WebDriver")
search_field.submit()

# Verify that the results page contains the expected text
assert "Selenium WebDriver" in driver.page_source

# Close the browser
driver.quit()
